The shell script "filter" filters out possible democratic and republican users based on keywords in their self-reported "descriptions".
However, in order to achieve a higher reliability of our labels, we manually adjust the labels of users which are disapproving or sarcastic.
For example:
  "my profile photo is me and my baby girl i am also very conservative on most issues ps I hate democrats I also love and support ISRAEL"
  is not a democrat
  "description": "I hate republicans"
  is not a republican
  even though both contains the keywords
The final labels after the manual adjustment is in new_dict.csv
