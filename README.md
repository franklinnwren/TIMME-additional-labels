The shell script "filter" filters out possible democratic and republican users based on keywords in their self-reported "descriptions".

However, in order to achieve a higher reliability of our labels, we manually adjust the labels of users which are disapproving or sarcastic.

For example:

"description": "my profile photo is me and my baby girl i am also very conservative on most issues ps I hate democrats I also love and support ISRAEL" is not a democrat

"description": "I hate republicans" is not a republican

even though both contain the keywords

The final labels after the manual adjustment are in new_dict.csv
